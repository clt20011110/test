    a)
        i. keyboard control: We didn't optimize it in Milestone2. Since it is a basic thing and optimizing it needs changing the update and message pattern, we spent a lot of time on modifying things.
        ii. duplicated codes in visual design and animation: due to time limits, we didn't make a thorough plan, which leads to low coding quaility. There should have been some more functions to simplify the codes.
        iii. work division: due to unreasonable work division. At some process, some of us did the same job somehow.
        Since the time is quite limited in our project 1, we don't have too much time to waste. We finished the whole coding process in about 3 days in Milestone 3.

    b)
        "Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.  At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. "
        Our development in project 1 isn't sustainable because of other courses and our own reasons. We want to improve this so as to maximize the efficiency. Our codes aren't excellent. Due to time limits, we didn't revise them, which leads to some chaos in the following stages.Reflection is also necessary.

    I think these principles will help a lot in our project 2. Our development in project 1 isn't sustainable because of other courses and our own reasons. We want to improve this so as to maximize the efficiency. Our codes aren't excellent. Due to time limits, we didn't revise them, which leads to some chaos in the following stages. We want to keep the code excellent from the very beginning in project 2 and keep them through the end, which will make codes clear and tidy. Reflection is also necessary.

    It can avoid choice paralysis and maximize your time, cost, and effort using to optimize the efficiency.

    I think our process is optimal, but our starting time is a little late, which made the final game not very fascinating in visual design. We've decided our game mechanics at an early stage. Based on that, we made a story. But the implementation of features had been done just three days before the due, which lead to a quite limited time for us to go to the next stage.

    Sprints are the backbone of any good Agile development team. And the better prepared you are before a sprint, the more likely you are to hit your goals. Sprint planning helps to refocus attention, minimize surprises, and guarantee better code gets shippied. More than that, sprint planning aligns the development team with the product owner. Like any relationship, the one between you and your team requires communication and clarity. And taking the time to sit down and make sure that your expectations are understood and can be done by your team is key to keeping everyone motivated and productive.

    Step 1: Review your product roadmap 20%
    Step 2: Groom your product backlog and update user stories 20%
    Step 3: Propose a sprint goal and backlog before the sprint planning meeting 25%
    Step 4: Use data and experience to supercharge your Sprint planning meeting 5%
    Step 5: Walk through each user story and describe what tasks need to be done 30%

    I think the most important one is step 5 because a clearly divided and clarified task is essential for a four-people group to finish the project. Also, step 3 should be emphasized because a clear goal can help and motivate us. To prepare for the sprint, one should be very familiar with what to do. So step 1 and 2 are equally important. Since we don't have time and methods to achieve step 4, this step can be omitted in our project.

## Ex2
### problem in p1:
1. no comment
2. using some bools instead of union types
3. using nested brackets instead of pipelines
4. some fucntions are too long, which should have been splitted into subfunctions.
5. there are some duplicated codes in some files, which should have been solved by writing some basic functions.

### planned solutions:
1. Write documentation ASAP.
2. Once a file is written, review it and decide whether it can be further simplified or be more readable.
3. Make a comprehensive plan before coding.

    Statically typed languages
    A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is (e.g.: Java, C, C++); 
    Examples: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala

    Dynamically typed languages
    A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time (unless using a statically-typed language with type inference).

    Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript

    I think statically typed languages is better because  all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage. This helps a lot when holding big projects.

    Facebook built Hiphop virtual machine (HHVM) to transfer PHP into machine code, which is a very fast way to implement and run PHP though PHP is in some ways ill-suited to running a website of such enormous size.

    Instagram engineers have also created developer tools such as LibCST for analyzing Python code. 

    They all developed their own methods to optimize the language and code and survive the initial mistake.

3. 
    
    Choose the language based on the scale of the project and the requirements of the project but not by its popularity.

4. 

    Go is syntactically similar to C. Rust is syntactically similar to C++. Go is mainly used for software development. Rust ensures memory safety and speed.
